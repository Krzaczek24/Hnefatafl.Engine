- Follow consistent indentation and formatting throughout the codebase. Use 4 spaces as base indentation.
- Write comments to explain complex logic and decisions in the code.
- Adhere to SOLID principles and best practices for object-oriented design.
- Write XML markup documentation for non test class methods.
- Use '// --- Arrange ---', '// --- Act ---', and '// --- Assert ---' comments in unit tests to separate different sections. Place those comments even if specific section will be empty.
